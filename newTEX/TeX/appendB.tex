A workpiece micro-positioning apparatus for correcting small pitch and yaw location errors in a workpiece supported on a fixture for a manufacturing operation such as precision machining or assembly comprises a biaxial micro-positioner that includes pitch and yaw motion mechanisms that support a workpiece for rotation about respective pitch and yaw axes. The yaw motion mechanism supports the pitch motion mechanism for rotation about a yaw axis generally normal to the pitch axis. A base supports the yaw motion mechanism.\par
A fixture fixed to the micro-positioner releasably holds a workpiece. The micro-positioner allows the fixture to rotate about the pitch and yaw axes to correct any pitch and yaw deviations from a desired workpiece attitude relative to the base and to releasably lock the pitch and yaw motion mechanisms following such correction. A manufacturing tool releasably supports the micro-positioner and rotates the micro-positioner, fixture and a workpiece mounted in the fixture, about a roll axis generally normal to the pitch and yaw axes as required to correct any roll error in workpiece attitude. The manufacturing tool then performs a manufacturing operation on the workpiece.\par
Fixturing is a critical and expensive process that must be undertaken in preparation for machining a workpiece such as a cylinder head for an internal combustion engine. In all high volume machining systems, dedicated fixtures are used to locate and hold workpieces. The dedicated nature of fixturing is arguably the greatest barrier to implementing truly flexible machining systems for workpieces.\par
