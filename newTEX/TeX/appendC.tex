A small-sized, lightweight rotary table apparatus is provided. The rotary table apparatus has: a support rest for rotatably supporting a rotary table; and a base for turnably supporting, in a cantilever fashion, the support rest by a shaft element, which is protrudingly formed on the support rest, being inserted into a hole provided in the base. The shaft element has formed therein a hollow section for accommodating at least a portion of a drive mechanism for rotating the rotary table.\par
